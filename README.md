# Matapan: The Financial Analyst for Expats

A minimal, opinionated net worth and financial analists built for expats.

#### The goal is simple:

Give a clear picture of net worth, cash flow, and investments without overengineering, while keeping the data fully user owned.

#### What was the Matapan?

The Matapan (or Grosso) was a silver coin used in the Republic of Venice during the late Middle Ages. It was known for its reliability and stability, making it a trusted currency for trade and commerce across different regions.

#### Why starting with expats?

- They usually have more complex financial situations.
- They often lack tailored financial tools.
- They poorly understand the fiscal incentives and trick of the Country they live in.
- They end up owning assets in multiple Countries and Currencies.

I am an Italian expat myself who worked and studied in 4 different Countries: Italy, Canada, Sweden, and China. I am building this to help people like me optimise their financial life abroad.

For now this app is the foundation for a future financial analyst platform tailored to expats.

It will always be an open source project and the data will always be yours. The plan for the future is to build paid services on top of it but keep the philosophy untouched.

Feel free to contribute with the data parsers for your banks and brokers! Also features are welcome as long as they respect the core principles.

Starting with common banks and brokers from Italy, Sweden, and China.

## How does this work so far?

The app creates a local json database with all the data parsed from the documents you have inputed.

The data is cleaned with a set of rules.

The description of the transactions is translated to English if not already.
